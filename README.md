# game_of_life
This small project is TypeScript implementation of the cellular automata Conway's game of life.

## Rules
Conway's game of life is cellular automata based on 4 simple rules:
 - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.
 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on.
 - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
